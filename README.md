# ApnoeClock

Training app for apnoe divers ... in progress

## Development technology
- Python (https://www.python.org/)
- Kivy (https://kivy.org/)
- SQLite3 (https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- Buildozer (https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## How can you help?
I would like to have a really good working app for my apnoe training. 
If you think, this app is good for you too, then 

- tell me what is missing or where could this app make something better for you?

This app is currently in German language only. It would be nice to have other 
languages available.

- you could help me with I18N: how to do this?
